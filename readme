# Calculating tyr-tyr interactions
# Follow this readme and all subsequet readme files -ajay

# First,i extracted the 2 protein chains
gmx make_ndx -f Tyrosine.gro
gmx trjconv -f Tyrosine.gro -o dimer.gro -n index.ndx

# then createed standalone topology (original.top - same as trp11.itp but easier to modify)
# edited original.top -> modified.top 
# make nrexcl very high (this makes intramoleculars zero - both lj and couloumb)
# make mainchain lj (sig and eps) and partial charges zero for mainchain atoms
# i had to rename one C to CZ to achieve this
# the resulting modified.top will evaluate only the required interaction energies

#Check atoms are identified correctly after renaming
see atom_change_check/readme

#Check if intramoleculars are zeroed out -
see single_chain_E_check/readme

#Calculate (tyrosine-tyrosine only)
see final_files/readme
